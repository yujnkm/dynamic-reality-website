# Welcome to our Lab!

The Dynamic Reality Lab (DRL) specializes in human-computer interaction in wide-area augmented reality. Our aim is to enhance human interaction in the physical world through spatial computing. We deploy sensing technologies such as EEG, EMG, and eye-tracking to interpret human behavior and optimize interactions in extended reality.
